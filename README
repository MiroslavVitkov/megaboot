Purpose
A minimalistic bootloader for the  Atmel mega8 microcontroller.

Advantages
Fits in the smallest selectable boot area.
Works out of the box for atmega8.
Reasonable error checking.
Fewer components and wires compared to an in system programmer. 

Preparation
sudo apt-get install cu lrzsz gcc-avr avr-libc

Usage
Hardware
Connect Tx and Rx lines to a PC.
Use MAX232 for serial port communication.
Alternatively use an FT232 for USB communication.
The makefile programs the atmega8 to 8MHz internal oscillator - hence no need for external crystal.

Uploading
You need to move the chip to a separate PCB, connected to an In Circuit Programmer.
make
make fuses
make upload
Now the bootloader is programmed into the higher section of the flash (the application still begins at 0x0).
Program an application that jumps to the bootloader address (???).
Before powering the board, iniciate firmware transfer from the connected PC.

Uploading the application
The bootloader uses the XMODEM transfer protocol.
